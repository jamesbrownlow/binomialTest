# Power and confidence:
For a given sample size, $n$ and a required $90^{th}$ percentile $p_{90}$,  
  1  Determing the probability  r of the n exceed the $90{th}$ percentile  
  2  For a specified $\delta$ determing the probability that r or fewer are less than $p_{90} - \delta$ 

$H_0$: 90th percentile $\le$ r  
$H_1$: 90th percentile $\gt$ r  

Count the number of test results that exceed r. Type I error: you reject $H_0$ when $H_0$ is true.
  
```{r}
n = 28
for (j in 24:n){
  print(paste(j, (1-pbinom(j, n, prob=0.9))))
}  

```
